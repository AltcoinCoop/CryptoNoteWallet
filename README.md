CryptoNoteWallet
================

A graphical .NET based wallet for Bytecoin based coins.

This program is a graphical wrapper around the bitmonerod.exe and simplewallet.exe command line utilties. It can be used to interact with the wallet and daemon in an easy way. 

NOTICE: Use at your own risk. This is a very early version. I'm not responsible for any loss of coins, exploding computers, etc.

Features:
- Show balance (locked and unlocked)
- Open wallets with *.bin or *.wallet extension
- Backup wallet on launch
- Create new wallets
- Show wallet address 
- Copy wallet address to clipboard
- Transfer coins
- Solo and pool mining
- Show logging from wallet and daemon
- Save wallet and daemon on exit.

Depends on:
- .NET 4.5 / Mono 3.2
- VS2012 or higher / MonoDevelop 4
